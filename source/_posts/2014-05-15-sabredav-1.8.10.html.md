We just released sabre/dav 1.7.12 and 1.8.10. These two releases are mainly
bugfix releases centering around two things:

* Better support for If-Match and If-None-Match
* Lots of updates in the [PATCH method][1].


Patch problems
--------------

We've gotten reports that there were problems with the PATCH plugin, and
the [associated documentation][1]. Things were inconsistent and plain
incorrect at times.

We've extended the documentation a great deal, now allowing you to correctly
use negative offsets for patching and also appending.

We've also added a new interface to enable this functionality, namely
`Sabre\DAV\PartialUpdate\IPatchSupport`.

The existing interface `Sabre\DAV\PartialUpdate\IFile` is now deprecated and
will be removed in a future major version of sabre/dav. This was unfortunately
needed to fix what was considered a bit of a mess.


VObject
-------

sabre/vobject in the zip package is now upgraded to 2.1.4, which works around
a backwards compatible break that was introduced in PHP 5.5.10 in relation to
timezones.

Upgrading
---------

To upgrade with composer, just run `composer update sabre/dav` on the command-
line.

The zip files can be found on [github][2].
