We just released sabre/event 2.0.0. This releases adds a few features, and
also slightly alters the API.

### New stuff

1. Support for [promises][2].
2. The event handler is now faster. This is especially noticeable when making a
   lot of subscriptions to a single event, and is likely unnoticeable for most.
3. Added support for something called the 'continue callback' to the
   EventEmitter. This makes it possible to implement something similar to
   javascript's `preventDefault`.
4. When calling removeAllListeners without an argument, all listeners for all
   events are removed.

### Api breaks

1. We switched to PSR-4 for autoloading.
2. EventEmitter::listeners() no longer returns a manipulatable array of event
   listeners by reference. It's not a simple list of callbacks, sorted by
   their priority. The original concept was good on paper.
3. The argument on `removeAllListeners` is now optional.

Upgrade sabre/event by making sure your composer.json references `~2.0.0`, and
then run:

    composer update sabre/event
