title: Installation
---

sabre/event must be installed using [composer][1].

Requirements
------------

You will need a recent version of PHP. sabre/event 5 requires PHP 7, but
sabre/event 3 is still actively maintained and works on PHP 5.5 and up.

Installing with composer
------------------------

If composer is not yet on your system, [follow the instructions on getcomposer.org][2]
to install it.

From your project directory, the easiest is then to simply call:

    composer require sabre/event ^{{site.latest_versions.event}}

This rule ensures that you install the latest event package in the 5.x range
of packages.

After running this, sabre/event should be installed, and you can load it in
by including the autoloader:

    include 'vendor/autoload.php';

Source
------

The sabre/event source can be found on [GitHub][3].
