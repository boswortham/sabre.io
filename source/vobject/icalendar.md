Getting started
---------------

Make sure you followed all the steps in the [installation instructions][1],
and you've included the autoloader in your code.


A basic parsing example
-----------------------

Assuming there is an iCalendar file in your local directory, named `party.ics`,
the following complete example will parse it and display the `SUMMARY` property:

    use Sabre\VObject;

    include 'vendor/autoload.php';

    $vcalendar = VObject\Reader::read(
        fopen('party.ics','r')
    );
    echo $vcalendar->VEVENT->SUMMARY;

That is all.

For all the following examples, we are assuming that you have already included
the autoloader, and also that you've called

    use Sabre\VObject;

at the top of your script. This is just to avoid repetition.


The actual manual
-----------------

### Creating a new iCalendar object

To create a new iCalendar object, you can construct a `VCalendar` component, and pass it
the structure you want.

Here's an example:

    $vcalendar = new VObject\Component\VCalendar([
        'VEVENT' => [
            'SUMMARY' => 'Birthday party!',
            'DTSTART' => new \DateTime('2016-07-04 21:00:00'),
            'DTEND'   => new \DateTime('2016-07-05 03:00:00')
        ]
    ]);

    echo $vcalendar->serialize();

This will output:

    BEGIN:VCALENDAR
    VERSION:2.0
    PRODID:-//Sabre//Sabre VObject 4.0.0-beta1//EN
    CALSCALE:GREGORIAN
    BEGIN:VEVENT
    UID:sabre-vobject-2930d1fa-ac6d-42c8-92fe-06bb8bc3614e
    DTSTAMP:20151202T171911Z
    SUMMARY:Birthday party!
    DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:20160704T210000
    DTEND;TZID=America/New_York:20160705T030000
    END:VEVENT
    END:VCALENDAR


### Manipulating properties

It's very easy to modify properties on objects:

    // Overwrites or sets a property:
    $vcalendar->VEVENT->SUMMARY = 'Funeral';

    // Removes a property
    unset($vcalendar->VEVENT->DTSTAMP);

    // Checks for existence of a property:
    isset($vcalendar->PRODID);

    // Adds a property without overwriting an existing one.
    $vcalendar->VEVENT->add('ATTENDEE', 'mailto:foo@example.com');
    $vcalendar->VEVENT->add('ATTENDEE', 'mailto:evert@example.com');

If your property name has a special character, such as the property
`LAST-MODIFIED`, you can access it as such:

    echo (string)$valendar->VEVENT->{'LAST-MODIFIED'};

### Working with parameters

iCalendar also has a concept of parameters on properties. This is a bit like
an "attribute" in xml or html.

An example of a property with a parameter:

    ATTENDEE;CN="Real name":mailto:foo@example.org

If you would want to get access to that parameter, you can use array-access to
do so:

    $realName = $vcalendar->VEVENT->ATTENDEE['CN'];

You can change it in the same manner:

    $vcalendar->VEVENT->ATTENDEE['RSVP'] = 'TRUE';

It is also possible add a list of parameters while creating the property.

    $vcalendar->VEVENT->add(
        'ATTENDEE',
        'foo@example.org',
        [
           'RSVP' => 'TRUE',
           'CN'   => 'Real Name',
        ]
    );

### Parsing iCalendar

To parse a vCard or iCalendar object, simply call:

    // $data must be either a string, or a stream.
    $vcard = VObject\Reader::read($data);

When you're working with data generated by broken software (such as the
latest Microsoft Outlook), you can pass a 'forgiving' option that will do an
attempt to mend the broken data.

    $vcalendar = VObject\Reader::read($data, VObject\Reader::OPTION_FORGIVING);

Many iCalendar objects these days are encoded as UTF-8. If however you are
running into an object  with a different encoding, you can specify this as the
third option:

    $vcard = VObject\Reader::read($data, 0, 'ISO-8859-1');

Currently ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252 are supported. This feature appeared in
vObject 4.


### Looping through properties.

Properties such as `ATTENDEE` may appear more than once in a
vCard. To loop through them, you can simply throw them in a `foreach()`
statement:

    foreach($vcalendar->VEVENT->ATTENDEE as $attendee) {
        echo 'Attendee ', (string)$attendee;
    }


### Working with Components

In iCalendar, `VTODO`, `VEVENT`, `VJOURNAL`, `VALARM` and several others
are all considered 'components'.

A calendar may have any one of these, and often multiple.

This is an example of a new VEVENT being added to a calendar:

    $vcalendar = new VObject\Component\VCalendar();

    $vcalendar->add('VEVENT', [
        'SUMMARY' => 'Birthday party',
        'DTSTART' => new \DateTime('2013-04-07'),
        'RRULE' => 'FREQ=YEARLY',
    ]);

    echo $vcalendar->serialize();

The `add()` method will always return the instance of the property or
sub-component it's creating. This makes for easy further manipulation.

Here's another example that adds an attendee and an organizer:

    $vcalendar = new VObject\Component\VCalendar();

    $vevent = $vcalendar->add('VEVENT', [
        'SUMMARY' => 'Meeting',
        'DTSTART' => new \DateTime('2013-04-07'),
    ]);

    $vevent->add('ORGANIZER','mailto:organizer@example.org');
    $vevent->add('ATTENDEE','mailto:attendee1@example.org');
    $vevent->add('ATTENDEE','mailto:attendee2@example.org');

If a `VCALENDAR` has multiple components, and you'd like to loop through them,
you can simply use foreach. This example goes through all the `VTODO`
components in a calendar.

    foreach($vcalendar->VTODO as $todo) {

        echo (string)$todo->SUMMARY;

    }


### Date and time handling

Parsing Dates and Times from iCalendar and vCard can be difficult.
Most of this is abstracted by the VObject library.

Given an event, in a calendar, you can get a real PHP `DateTime` object using
the following syntax:

    $start = $vcalendar->VEVENT->DTSTART->getDateTime();
    echo $start->format(\DateTime::W3C);

To update the property with a new `DateTime` object, just use the following syntax:

    $dateTime = new \DateTime('2012-08-07 23:53:00', new \DateTimeZone('Europe/Amsterdam'));
    $event->DTSTART = $dateTime;


### Free-busy report generation

Some calendaring software can make use of FREEBUSY reports to show when people are
available.

You can automatically generate these reports from calendars using the `FreeBusyGenerator`.

Example based on our last event:

    // We're giving it the calendar object. It's also possible to specify multiple objects,
    // by setting them as an array.
    //
    // We must also specify a start and end date, because recurring events are expanded.
    $fbGenerator = new VObject\FreeBusyGenerator(
        new DateTime('2012-01-01'),
        new DateTime('2012-12-31'),
        $vcalendar
    );

    // Grabbing the report
    $freebusy = $fbGenerator->getResult();

    // The freebusy report is another VCALENDAR object, so we can serialize it as usual:
    echo $freebusy->serialize();

The output of this script will look like this:

    BEGIN:VCALENDAR
    VERSION:2.0
    PRODID:-//Sabre//Sabre VObject 2.0//EN
    CALSCALE:GREGORIAN
    BEGIN:VFREEBUSY

    FREEBUSY;FBTYPE=BUSY:20121210T140000Z/20121210T140000Z
    END:VFREEBUSY
    END:VCALENDAR


### Validating iCalendar

When you parse an iCalendar document, the parser grabs all the values and does
basic syntax checking. It does not however, validate every value.

You can ask the parser to validate the entire document by calling the `validate`
function though:

    $result = $vcalendar->validate();

The returned value is an array of messages and might look like this:

    [
        [
            'level' => 2,
            'message' => '...',
            'node' => ...A VObject component or property...
        ]
    ]

Each item constitutes a problem with the document. Every item contains a level
containing a number between 1 and 3. 3 Means that the document is invalid, 2
means a warning. A warning means it's valid but it could cause interoperability
issues, and 1 means that there was a problem earlier, but the problem was
automatically repaired.

The message is a human-readable string with more information about the problem,
and lastly the node refers to the actual VObject Component or Property object
that had the issue.

You can also pass several options. The options have to be passed as a bitfield:

    $vcalendar->validate(Sabre\VObject\Node::REPAIR);
    $vcalendar->validate(Sabre\VObject\Node::PROFILE_CALDAV);

The `REPAIR` option automatically repairs the object, if possible. Without
`REPAIR` the validator does not change the object.

The `PROFILE_CALDAV` validates the object specifically for within the use of
CalDAV. iCalendar objects on CalDAV servers have a few additional special
restrictions (no `METHOD` may appear, only one component per document, etc..).

The validator is not perfect, and we improve it when we come across new issues,
so any suggestions are welcome.
